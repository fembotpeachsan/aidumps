  "description": "CATRNN’s Darwin Machine 1.0a (CATv0) is a self-improving AI that evolves its own codebase through open-ended, Darwinian exploration and empirical benchmarking. The system maintains an archive of coding agents, continuously generating and validating novel variants for performance and safety. Each agent modifies itself, improving both its problem-solving and self-editing skills in parallel. This process forms a growing tree of high-quality, diverse agents and unlocks endless innovation. CATv0 automates asset extraction, self-coding, and recursive improvement across games, apps, and AI pipelines with zero config."
